**Overview**

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies** and focuses on **location-based data analysis** and a **restaurant recommendation system**. The goal is to explore, analyze, and model real-world datasets to generate insights and build practical solutions using machine learning techniques.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks covering all tasks and recorded videos demonstrating the work and outcomes.

**Requirements**

To run the notebooks in this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`



**How it Works**


The project consists of multiple notebooks:

Giriprasanth_S.ipynb
A consolidated notebook covering all internship tasks such as preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

Location_based_Analysis.ipynb
Focuses on analyzing spatial and geographic data to extract patterns and trends.

Restaurant_Recommendation.ipynb
A content-based recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences and data analysis.


**Demo Videos**

These videos demonstrate real-time execution and explanation of the project tasks.

**Results**


Each notebook produces visual insights, model evaluation metrics, and final outputs. You can find the following deliverables:

📊 Graphs and plots visualizing data trends.

🤖 Machine learning models with accuracy and evaluation results.

📍 Recommended restaurant listings based on user input.
