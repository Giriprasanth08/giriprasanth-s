## Overview

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies** and focuses on **location-based data analysis** and a **restaurant recommendation system**. The goal is to explore, analyze, and model real-world datasets to generate insights and build practical solutions using machine learning techniques.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks covering all tasks and recorded videos demonstrating the work and outcomes.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`



## How it Works
This project consists of three main Jupyter notebooks:

**Giriprasanth_S.ipynb**
Covers data cleaning, transformation, and machine learning applications.

**Location_based_Analysis.ipynb**
Performs detailed location-based statistical analysis and geographic feature extraction.

**Restaurant_Recommendation.ipynb**
A content-based recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences and data analysis.
