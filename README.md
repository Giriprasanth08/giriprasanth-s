## Overview

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies** and focuses on **location-based data analysis** and a **restaurant recommendation system**. The goal is to explore, analyze, and model real-world datasets to generate insights and build practical solutions using machine learning techniques.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks covering all tasks and recorded videos demonstrating the work and outcomes.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the libraries (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
